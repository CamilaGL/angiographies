# angiographies

This readme is just to help me organise this mess of a repository.

## Getting Started

Please be sure to set up the required tools before trying to run the scripts.

## Packages

First of all, you should install anaconda.
Up to date, the following sets of libraries and toolkits have been established:


### vtk vmtk simpleitk scikit-image

#### Installation

conda create --name angiographies

conda install python=3.6 scikit-image simpleitk vmtk -c simpleitk -c vmtk

cd <project folder>

pip install -e .

conda install llvm=3.3


#### Usage

If on VisualStudioCode, it is possible to simply pick the conda environment on which the script is going to run.
